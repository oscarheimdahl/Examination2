              Mehdi Benjelloun (born 10 November 1999) known by his stage name
              Petit Biscuit, is a French DJ and music producer.<br /><br />
              The 20-year-old French producer has been taking the world by storm
              with his signature sound, forged through combining acoustic
              elements, innovative electronic production, and his trademark
              vocal manipulations. The eclecticism of this combination is
              reflective of his background in the polar spheres of electronica
              and classical music. <br /><br />
              He has been touring the world including a performance at Coachella
              in 2018.
